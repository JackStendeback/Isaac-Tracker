# Isaac-Tracker
An application made to help conjoin my love for coding with my love for the popular game, Binding of Isaac. I want to create an application that allows me to track my achievement progress, item unlock progress, character statistics, biblical references, etc.

# To Be Added(Binding of Isaac Tracker):
* All achievements with their descriptions, how to unlock them, and progress towards unlocking them.
* All unlocked items(for me personally). What they do, good pairings(synergies) I find.
* All Characters and statistics for each, including attempts, deaths, victories.
* All bosses encountered, statistics for each and a ranking as to what I think is hard vs easy.
* A section for noting the biblical references I see or discover by playing through the game.
* Tips for my future self, how to find secrets, etc etc.
* More to be added as I see fit.
